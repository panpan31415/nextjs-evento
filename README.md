-   **Schema Definition**: Defined data models and relationships using Prisma schema.
-   **Migrations**: Managed database migrations and seeding data.

### Zod

-   **Schema Validation**: Utilized Zod for validating data structures and API inputs.
-   **Type Safety**: Ensured type safety by integrating Zod with TypeScript.
